# True Form

# # Goals
## To make the project feasible
- A basic skeletal form { soln : React form }
- Data approachproach i.e:
    - ~What data user will enter~
    - ~In what format the data is transferred~ 
    - What Back end solutions will be implemented (Ease first approach (No "scratch" philosophy))
    - Database solution: hmm that's trickier (Local storage?)
- Our lifeline if we are stuck?🤞🏼🫠😂🥲👍
